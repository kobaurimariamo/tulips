        Tulips are spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes in the
         Tulip genus. Their flowers are usually large, 
        showy, and brightly coloured, 
        generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white. They often have a 
        different coloured blotch at the base of the teals, internally.The most known meaning of tulips is perfect and deep love. 
        As tulips are a classic flower that has been loved by many for centuries they have been attached with the meaning of love.
         They're ideal to give to someone who you have a deep, 
        unconditional love for, whether it's your partner, children, parents or siblings.For hundreds of years, the tulip has been 
        one of the most-loved flowers in the Netherlands. An enduring icon, it's as synonymous with the country as clogs, 
        windmills and cheese. The tulip has a long and storied history
         - including the infamous shortage in the 17th century known as “tulip mania”.The tulip was different from other 
         flowers known to Europe at that time, because of its intense saturated petal color. The appearance of 
         the nonpareil tulip as a status
          symbol coincides with the rise of newly independent Holland's trade fortunes.A tulip is a self-pollinating 
          plant, meaning that the flower can transfer pollen from the anther to the stigma without a pollinator. 
          The plant is also a cross-pollinating flower relying on insects, the wind, man or animals to carry pollen
           from one tulip bloom to another.
